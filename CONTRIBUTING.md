### GETTING STARTED

#### What is this repository about?

This repository provides guidance and resources for starting your own Mozilla Study Group. Mozilla Study Groups are fun, informal meetups of your friends and colleagues from around your local institution or town to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers. 

Here you will find the templates for setting up websites, events and creating lessons.

#### How do I join the community?

There are a few things you can do to learn more and decide if you want to join our community.
- **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is available via the drop down menu under your profile picture in the top right).
- **Check out the issue tracker:** click on 'Issues' in the sidebar on the right; this is where all the conversations we are having live. Use this space to ask questions, request events, make suggestions, or just say "Hi."

#### What is the Code of Conduct?

Mozilla Study Groups are for everyone - we abide by a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels welcome, and we'll all have a better time!
